# ReactNative
React Native is a popular framework for building mobile applications using JavaScript and React. Here are some steps to get you started:

### Set up your development environment:

Install Node.js and npm (Node Package Manager)
Install React Native CLI or use Expo CLI for an easier setup
### Create a new React Native project:

Using React Native CLI: npx react-native init MyNewProject
Using Expo CLI: npx create-expo-app MyNewProject
### Run your application:

For React Native CLI: npx react-native run-android or npx react-native run-ios
For Expo CLI: npx expo start
### Learn the basics of React Native:

Understand the core components (View, Text, Image, ScrollView, etc.)
Learn about state and props
Get familiar with navigation using libraries like React Navigation
### Build and debug your application:

Use the emulator/simulator to test your app
Debug using React DevTools and other debugging tools
Explore advanced topics:

### Learn about performance optimization
Explore native modules and how to bridge them
Understand the deployment process for both Android and iOS

# MongoDB 
MongoDB is a NoSQL database that stores data in a document-oriented format using JSON-like structures called BSON (Binary JSON). It is designed for high performance, scalability, and flexibility, making it a popular choice for modern web applications.

## **Key Features of MongoDB:**

1.Schema-less (Flexible Schema) – Unlike SQL databases, MongoDB does not require a fixed table schema, allowing you to store different types of data in the same collection.

2.Document-Oriented – Data is stored in BSON documents, which makes it easy to represent complex structures.

3.Scalability – Supports horizontal scaling through sharding (distributing data across multiple servers).

4.High Performance – Faster read/write operations due to its document model.

5.Indexing – Supports indexing to optimize query performance.

6.Aggregation Framework – Provides powerful data processing and transformation capabilities.

7.Replication – Supports data redundancy using Replica Sets to ensure data availability.

MongoDB vs SQL Databases
Feature	MongoDB (NoSQL)	SQL Databases (MySQL, PostgreSQL)
Data Model	Document-based (JSON/BSON)	Table-based (Rows & Columns)
Schema	Flexible (No predefined schema)	Fixed schema (Strict structure)
Scalability	Horizontally scalable (Sharding)	Vertically scalable (Scaling up)
Query Language	MongoDB Query Language (MQL)	SQL (Structured Query Language)
Transactions	Supports ACID transactions (since MongoDB 4.0)	Fully ACID-compliant
